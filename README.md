# Overview

This is just a personal repo to store as many data structure implementations as I can make. Time to time I come here and write something for practice. Most files are unfinished and there is no guarantee that any of this code is production ready/worthy.

## General Structure

Every Language contains the following implementations:

* Algorithms
  * Sorting Algorithms
    * Bubble Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Many More
    * Some Fun Ones
  * Matrix Algorithms
  * Graph Traversal
    * BFS
    * DFS
* Data Structures
  * Graphs and Trees
    * Includes Heaps
    * Tries
  * Linear Algebra
  * Sequential Data Structures
* Extra FizzBuzz Solution

***Some Implementations are more complete than OTHERS!!***

## Languages

* C/C++
* Rust
* Java
* JavaScript
* Python
* TBD...

More languages will be added as I learn more.
